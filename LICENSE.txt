This version uses a few tricks to achieve better performance and/or
lower CPU utilization:

- To control LED brightness, traditional PWM is eschewed in favor of
  Binary Code Modulation, which operates through a succession of periods
  each twice the length of the preceeding one (rather than a direct
  linear count a la PWM).  It's explained well here:

    http://www.batsocks.co.uk/readme/art_bcm_1.htm

  I was initially skeptical, but it works exceedingly well in practice!
  And this uses considerably fewer CPU cycles than software PWM.

- Although many control pins are software-configurable in the user's
  code, a couple things are tied to specific PORT registers.  It's just
  a lot faster this way -- port lookups take time.  Please see the notes
  later regarding wiring on "alternative" Arduino boards.

- A tiny bit of inline assembly language is used in the most speed-
  critical section.  The C++ compiler wasn't making optimal use of the
  instruction set in what seemed like an obvious chunk of code.  Since
  it's only a few short instructions, this loop is also "unrolled" --
  each iteration is stated explicitly, not through a control loop.
